# Expense-Tracker

The Expense App is a website where you can manage your expenses. It's easy to use and lets you add, edit, and delete transactions. You can also analyse your expenses and income by selecting a specific date range. The app also includes a feature to split bills among friends, and you can change the appearance of the app by selecting a different theme. Once a transaction has been added or removed, reload the page.
